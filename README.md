Interviews... Interviews never change.

So what is this all about? Well I wanted some change and I thought quitting my current job (LOL bad idea) and moving a couple cities away would revive my passion for "solving cool problems". 

Anyways, 5 years of experience writing quality tested production code, and I can't solve any [leetcode](https://leetcode.com/) problems. Honestly, I think I was better at these interview problems when I was a scrub straight out of dev bootcamp.

So... Here we go again. Same shit different day. This will be an index of all the interview crap I need to know. Goodluck future me.


## Algorithms

Stolen from geeksforgeeks
```
So when to use DFS over A*, when to use Dijkstra over A* to find the shortest paths ?
We can summarise this as below-

1) One source and One Destination-
→ Use A* Search Algorithm (For Unweighted as well as Weighted Graphs)

2) One Source, All Destination –
→ Use BFS (For Unweighted Graphs)
→ Use Dijkstra (For Weighted Graphs without negative weights)
→ Use Bellman Ford (For Weighted Graphs with negative weights)

3) Between every pair of nodes-
→ Floyd-Warshall
→ Johnson’s Algorithm
```

Now remember what any of these algorithms are.
